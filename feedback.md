### Project Feedback + Evaluation

Your instructors will be grading you using this rubric.

For each criterion below, instructors will give you a score according to the following guidelines. "Ticking" all of the boxes for a criterion will earn a "meets expectations".

They will also assign a **Total Score**, to serve as an overall gauge of whether you met the project goals. However, __the more important scores are the individual ones__, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!

| Score | Expectations |
| :---- | :----------- |
| **0** | _Does not meet expectations_ |
| **1** | _Meets expectactions_ |
| **2** | _Exceeds expectations_ |

## Project Workflow - Meets expectations
##### How effectively did you plan, execute, and present this project?
- The `readme.md` file contains any necessary installation instructions

> You'll want to update the readme as described [here](https://github.com/ga-dc/project2#deliverables). You'll want this before you put this project in your portfolio.

- The `planning` folder contains:
  - a picture / screenshot of your ERD (up to date!)
  - a `wireframes` directory, which in turn contains at least 2 drawings or photos of wireframes and ERDs
  - a `user_stories.md` file, which in turn contains at least 7 user stories (or a link to a Trello board or equivalent)

  > Didn't find a planning directory. Make sure to add this, it will be good to have when interviewing.

- A Github issue was submitted to the `project2` repository **by 11:00am on Friday, November 20<sup>th</sup>,** containing a link to a hosted video

> :+1:

- The video itself and/or the site on which it can be found contains a website or e-mail address through which the creator can be contacted

> :+1:

- The video is at least 3 minutes long, but **no more than** 5 minutes

> :+1:

- The video contains:
  - A description and demo of the app :+1:
  - A code sample explaining one thing of which the creator is proud :+1:
  - One thing the creator would do differently next time _not sure_
  - The next feature the creator would like to implement
  :+1:

## Technical Requirements - Exceeds expectations
##### How well does your app demonstrate a grasp of the technologies introduced in class?
- The app contains at least 2 models

> :+1: above and beyond

- The app contains at least 1 association

> :+1: several including a has many through - good work!

- At least 1 model incorporates `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` routes

> :+1: two do!

## Creativity / Interface - Exceeds expectations
##### How memorable and enjoyable to use is your app?
- The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS

> :+1: Great job! App is intuitive and usable. Styling is clean and functionality is really solid. I like the personality in things like the flash notifications

- The app delivers something of value to the end user: it is not just a login button and an index page

> :+1: The app while being a kind of has an opinion on todo lists which it is promoting with the quote and functionality.

## Code Quality - Meets expectations
##### How able would an uninformed programmer be to reuse and extend your code?
- The code follows style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, indenting, modularity, and semantic naming

> :+1: Great job! Code is clean and clear.

- The code is commented only with what is necessary to document what is happening in the code

> There is some commented out code in the tasks controller relating to task assignment. You can just keep that on a separate branch

- For any page, copying its source code as it appears in the **browser** and pasting it into the [W3 Validator](http://validator.w3.org) yields 0 errors

> Couple of errors on the new task page. Be careful to check html produced by templates with a lot of helpers in them. Easy to accidentally miss little things.

## Deployment and Functionality - Meets expectations
##### How accessible is your app to those who may want to explore it?
- Cursory use of the app by an uninformed user yields no errors that "break" it

> :+1:

- The app is deployed to Heroku (or another hosting service)

> :+1:

- The contents of the creator's Github repository is identical to that of the Heroku repository

> :+1:

- The `URL` field of the Github repository contains a link to the deployed version of the app

:+1: Make sure to add this and put the video url in the readme
